                            STIs are a very common problem, but many people do not realize they have one because there are often no symptoms. The only way to know for sure is to get tested. If you think you might have an STI, you must see a doctor or other healthcare providers to get treatment. Left untreated, STIs can cause serious health problems. So please do not wait—get tested today.

										<p><span>Genital Herpes is</span> an infection caused by the herpes simplex virus (HSV). It can be caught through sexual contact and often doesn’t present symptoms.

									</div>
									<div class="col-lg-6">
										<p>When present, symptoms may begin about two to 12 days after exposure to the virus. If you experience symptoms of genital herpes, they may include:</p>
										<ul>
											<li><span>Pain or itching.</span> You may experience pain and tenderness in your genital area until the infection clears.</li>
											<li><span>Small red bumps or tiny white blisters.</span> These may appear a few   days to a few weeks after infection.</li>
											<li><span>Ulcers.</span> These may form when blisters rupture and ooze or bleed. Ulcers may make it painful to urinate.</li>
											<li><span>Scabs.</span> Skin will crust over and form scabs as ulcers heal.</li>
										</ul>
										<p>
											During an initial outbreak, you may have flu-like signs and symptoms such as swollen lymph nodes in your groin, headache, muscle aches, and fever.
